    "In sports, ranking teams is done in a number of ways. Win percentage is a very simple approach, though a drawback is you only know how a team compares to the other teams it played. For large groups of teams it is not possible for each team to play every other team. Here you will apply linear algebra ideas to overcome this challenge in two ways.\n",

    "For this project, you will read a paper ([PAPER LINK](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228435078_Bracketology_How_can_math_help)), explain approaches, and reproduce major findings.\n",
